Note: Till 2016 i was either working on this papers to get placed in a company or because of competitive environment. But after that I made it as a hobby or a personal work for certain reasons rather than only for carrer. I felt that the power of softwares(programs) is growing exponential than hardwares so i made sure that my works and efforts also falls inside it.
