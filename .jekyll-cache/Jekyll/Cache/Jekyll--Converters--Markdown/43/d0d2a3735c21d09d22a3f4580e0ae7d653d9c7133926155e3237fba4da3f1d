I"2<p>There was a sitation in my life at 2016 , i realised that i need to specialize in a domain which is 
needed for the technical world ,purposefull with good problem statements and exciting to me.</p>

<p>I work on below things for learning purpose and open source contribution:
    - Writing Research papers
    - Solving issues in pytorch and opecv repos - started
    - Building small libraries in python which is not readily available in pip or conda - started</p>

<p>2021 - 2023</p>

<ul>
  <li>I would be trying to specialize on building good Agents for custom environments ,purposes,with custom problem statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>2023 - 2026</p>

<ul>
  <li>I would be trying to build the world(in stimulation) and agents for certian things which i am not able to prove 100/100 people in real world in a certain part of my life. Hence it would have both theoretical and experimental(recreatable) proof.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sequential Problem statements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build genric agents that can co-exist and live a normal peacefull life with humans.</li>
  <li>Agents that can understand the cyclic environments and break or co exist in it, Embeddings construction, matching and destruction, Parallel exploit, Sequential exploit, Fracatal observance, encoding and decoding.</li>
  <li>Taking agents to extra ordinary sitations where agents tries to change the furture by constucting artifically movements out of nature.</li>
  <li>Environment upgrade takes place by env evolution and env tries to make other agents to make artifically constructed variables/objects and corrupt the Agents actions and predictions.</li>
  <li>Agents realizes that enviroment has upgraded and learns to differentiate artificailly constucted variables/objects and naturally constructed objects and makes the actions with respective to it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: We can call only a successfull agent deployed in a hardware as a robot.Robot means a RL robot which was trained in stimulation rather than rules.</p>

<p><strong>Hope i beilive that this will look NEAR and possible in step by step manner</strong></p>
