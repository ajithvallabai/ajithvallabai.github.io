  I am a Computer Vision Engineer in Lotte Data Communication R &amp D Center India.I studied Deep learning and Reinforcement learning for Computer Vision from The School of A.I Bangalore.

  I work in Artificial Intelligence at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning &amp Robotics.
  
  My goal in AI field is to </br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1. Build genric agents that can co-exist and live a normal peacefull life with humans. </br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2. Agents that can understand the cyclic environments and break or co exist in it, Embeddings construction, matching and destruction, Parallel exploit, Sequential exploit, Fracatal observance, encoding and decoding. </br>

</br>
</br>

    I believe understanding of chronological development of a human can aide in development 
  of genric agents. if we are able to build a bairn agents with small ability which develops in time and acquires skills, we can build cognition/Artificial general intelligence.
